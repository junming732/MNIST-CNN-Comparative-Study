A comprehensive implementation and analysis of various neural network architectures on the MNIST dataset.

## üìñ Overview

This project implements and benchmarks multiple models to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

2. Run an experiment
 ```bash
python train.py --model cnn --optimizer adam --epochs 10
 ```

 ## üìÅ Code Structure

The project is modularized for clarity and reusability:
- `models/`: Contains PyTorch module definitions for all architectures.
- `utils/`: Contains boilerplate code for training, data loading, and visualization.
- `main.py`: The main script to orchestrate experiments and parse command-line arguments.

*This project was completed as part of the Deep Learning (1RT720) course at Uppsala University.*
